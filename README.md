## Description: (how to run the program, phone/emulator screen size, android version ie 11)
- Upon start up of app, you may select from the drop down in the upper left a preset bot. Then, connect to a game by clicking the network symbol and filling out the dialog box with the IP address and Username. Hit submit to connect with the game. The left joystick controls movement and the right joystick controls direction of fire. The red button is the fire button. Try to win.
- Moto G Power 2021: resolution of 720x1600 pixels, 20:9 ratio
- Android version 11
## Anything that doesn't work:
- Be careful with moving and firing. There is nothing to prevent queueing too many messages. I actually got used to playing it that way so I don't mind, but it's a learning curve. Basically, you need to get used to not holding down the move button, that is all.
